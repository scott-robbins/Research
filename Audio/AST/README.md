# AUDIO STYLE-TRANSFER <AST>
[1] Realtime audio signal processing 

[2] On backend, attempt signal isolation
  on multi-tracked training data.

[2a] Finger print target audio-tracks/signals
  
    * Rhythm/Tempo/Timing variations 
    
    * Domain of Pitch/*FFT Profile* 
    
    * Complexity - (structure of FFT Profile?
    
    * Tonal Structure/Selections (Sequential Data)

[3] Mimicry! (?! STYLE TRANSFER ?!)
