# Generative 

# Style Transfer
Using the pre-trained VGG-19 CNN Model, we can use this python code (found elsewhere
and modified. I did not write all of the ex.py!) to essentially create a hybrid image
of two input images. 

The standard example is a cross using the content of a Taipei skyline and overlaying 
with the style of Starry Night. 

But experimenting further you can try some interesting examples. Particularly, trying
to find interesting 'style' content (as not all style transfers the same in terms of 
distorting/enhancing the content). For example, the artist Alex Grey is known for a 
very particular style (much like Van Gogh and starry night), however his style is not
only a lot of interesting background textures, but there's also the way he highlights
the body of a subject. Taking the following image of Trey Anastasio (lead guitar and 
frontman of rock band Phish) and a painting of Alex Grey's, the result is quite neat.
