## Basic Exploitation 

### Using GDB 
So we have this highly vulnerable program vulnerable_1.c and compile it to an 
executable called login. 

We can open this compiled program and in gdb with ```$ gdb login```

Using ```disassemble main``` you can pause execution of the program before being
prompted for a password by setting a breakpoint before the scanf call:

When we get here, one way we might find useful information is looking at memory.
If the program has left hardcoded variables in their code, we can find them as 
shown and exploit this knowledge!!

Maybe we aren't lucky enough to have a hardcoded string left in the binary. What then?

One trick is to actually patch the code of a binary. In this case, there's a strcmp 
responsible for whether or not we get ACCESS GRANTED. So why not just change the 
code to do the opposite logic (if our password is *wrong* we're given access)?
