# Exploits
I find it really interesting when computers start to do 
things they "weren't intended to do". But the nuances of 
binary analysis are *so* intricate. This repo is my slow
journey to try and understand aspects of binary analysis, 
and how one takes a look at code, and make it do something
it was not intended to do. 

For example, I wrote a really shitty login in C and took a look
at the internals while running in GDB. Because I left hardcoded 
strings in the source, figuring out the correct login is actually
quite trivial!
