# Exploits
I find it really interesting when computers start to do 
things they "weren't intended to do". But the nuances of 
binary analysis are *so* intricate. This repo is my slow
journey to try and understand aspects of binary analysis, 
and how one takes a look at code, and make it do something
it was not intended to do. 

For example, I wrote a really shitty login in C and took a look
at the internals while running in GDB. Because I left hardcoded 
strings in the source, figuring out the correct login is actually
quite trivial!

# Fun With Shells and Privelege
I found this nifty C program that is interesting to me on two levels. 
First, it is written is but is essentially an assembly program. And, 
second it's the foundation for further exploits of a class known as 
**Return Oriented Program**. Let's look at the program, and then see
what it does. 

So here's the source of `rop.c`:
``
int main() {
  asm("\
needle0: jmp there\n\
here:    pop %rdi\n\
         xor %rax, %rax\n\
         movb $0x3b, %al\n\
         xor %rsi, %rsi\n\
         xor %rdx, %rdx\n\
         syscall\n\
there:   call here\n\
.string \"/bin/sh\"\n\
needle1: .octa 0xedacef0d\n\
  ");
}
``
As you may be able to tell, this function pops a shell. Here's what it looks like:
